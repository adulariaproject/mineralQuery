This application converts weight percents to formula units for common rock forming minerals. We have two calculators that use different methods:

### anion method
- The formula units are calculated based on the amount of anions.

### Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio method
- The formula is calculated based on the amount of cations, anions and charge balance.
